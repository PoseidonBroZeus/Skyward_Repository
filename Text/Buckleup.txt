Clay Morrison is a fighter type hero
He’s actually slowly phasing out of being a hero and wants to be an actor and arena fighter
This won’t work because Clay is in line to be the next champion of his region
Each region has a champion that attends regional events, defends the area, and becomes a political figure that represents the interests of the community
Owl world is large so one size fits all laws are hard
But mostly things are the same
This is because of the 100-day galactic communion where all champions of owl world (even extra planetary ones like Deneye) attend a 100-day meeting where they discuss deep philosophical issues and attempt to solve every problem they currently have in the span of that 100-day meeting
There has only been 3 meetings, the first was long ago, when death was still in owl world, the second was after they found out they were under the gods control 
The third was after Cooleo killed the gods
There will soon be a fourth in cooleos time that will focus on the power problem
Each champion must be twice as educated as they are strong
Clay had spectated the third meeting but has never been in one
And being a champion would be a lot for him
He has other passions
One being to locate the Omni Buckle
One deeply shadowed in legend
But being a champion wouldn’t allow him to travel far, and certainly not for very long times
(Travel is a pre-Gamie issue)
Clay wants to be an arena fighter and actor after he requires the Omni Buckle, and plans to film his search for it.
But that is just a dream
Currently he is still training to be a champion in his region
He talks to a lot of people and is quite social
He’s nowhere near a top rank fighter but his region isn’t a very prominent one so it’s significance isn’t too demanding
So his work hours are alright
Only owl city has the sleepless heroes
(Owl world capital)
(Center of the world type shit)
On his off time Clay practices broadway and chats with friends
He has a Hootube account that is quite famous
He does skits and makeup tutorials
He talks about wanting to find his soulmate sometime in the future
He’s tried having a relationship with a couple guys but he hasn’t clicked with someone yet
He has considered Cooleo
Cooleo has shown up to some of his performances even though sleeping through some
Clay has asked Cooleo to look out for the Omni Buckle on his journey
Cooleo is conceptually incapable of comprehending what a buckle is
And just brings Clay cool stuff he’s found and sometimes belt buckles
Even though not what he’s looking for, Clay still thanks Cooleo for his efforts.
