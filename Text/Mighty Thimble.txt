Mighty thimble lived in a family of multiple retired SDS members and therefore was privy to the field of work, the combat aspect was definitely a thing he was prepared for, but he was more for the teamwork aspect than anything. T
His real name is Timothy thimble
Thimble inherited the stitching technique from his grandmother who was one member of the family who didn’t fight in the hero force, although she did spend a week as a villain in order to break into her bullies house and steal his socks
The stitching technique was viewed as a weaker ability that couldn’t do much more than stitch fabric together
But Thimble revolutionized the technique by applying it to the skin of owls
This would become his ability that he mastered
His axe is self made with the hilt and ax tips being made from a material discovered around the planet
It is thought to have fallen from the Skyward Citadel, home of the gods
His power became a show stopper for his area
He moved to Owl City when he was experienced enough to start hero training, before he left his grandmother told him that his strength was greater than that of any other member in the family, and that he will be a strong center for a team
But that he will need to learn the importance of teamwork, as a center is nothing by themselves, or at least they work best with a team.
She says that a good team is like a well knitted pair of socks, with each thread being a person, and that they can only protect the foot properly when they all weave together in perfect harmony.
Grandma really seems to like socks.
Thimble has a high raw damage output and climbed the ranks of the SDS and was later moved to be chief leader of the new spinoff team with more members of wider power ranges, called the SSDS
this was where Timothy became the veteran amongst newbies, with the age requirement of the SSDS was also lower, and with more owls with a lot of power, but little education.
Thimble has had trouble with being a leader, when he was a Center, he wasn’t a leader, he just needed to hold his own for as long as it took for his teammates to get the rest of the job done.
But now he had to tell them what to do, plus while he chose himself as Center, he knew that he’d soon have to get the team to choose their own center so he could go teach another team
His desire to take all responsibility for his team was in his eyes a good thing, and that taking most of the heat was good and at one point he would just choose the strongest member to be the next center 
This, however, was not how things would go down when they were tasked with shutting down an illegal killground (a place where any owl can fight to the death) out in the Jaggedpyke Desert. 
Upon intercepting the owls behind this killground, they told the hosts to bug off, and they did.
Everyone did except for one owl.
Hell Stinger
This owl was known for having his own fan base on Hootube who liked to watch him livestream duels and maximum damage tests
Hell Stinger said he didn’t have to leave, the killground is already taken down and he’s just there to be there, getting some more action shots for his viewers
Hell stinger didn’t live with his parents cause they knew he was quite the rebel and so let him go wherever he wanted to
So anywhere was his home
Thimble did not like this and threatened to push him out of the area if he kept resisting
Hell Stingers fight was canceled because of Thimble so he was ready to go
Mighty thimble began the engage, and left his teammates to follow suit
He would’ve won if his teamwork was good, but it wasn’t, he went in like he was a Center, and not like he was a captain, leaving his team with little knowledge of what to do
Due to Thimble absorbing most of the fights and not allowing his team to work on doing the heavy lifting, they had an artificial synergy, their team rank was even being pushed up from Thimble alone.
So when it came down to the fight, against an enemy who was fast, agile, strong, and most importantly, intelligent, the battle was winnable by both parties
Stinger fought with one hand at first, with a spear in one hand and a phone streaming the action in the other. 
Thimbles charge would have broken Hell Stinger in half if it had hit, but Stinger knew his disadvantage in that matchup and so zipped behind thimble
Thimble had been the only one who had charged as far as he did, so with him expecting to turn around to a Hell Stinger coming at him from behind, he was surprised to see that Stinger had kept flying away from Thimble and straight into his team who was a distance away from Thimble
Hell Stinger knew that this separation was a big mistake on thimbles end and a big advantage for himself, so he made sure to make quick work of the team, killing half of them and either knocking out, or severely injuring the rest
Once he was done with them and Thimble had notice what had happened, Stinger propped his phone on the ground and finally came at Thimble
The fight was close on both sides, even though Stinger never took a hit, every swing of Thimbles axe could have totaled him
But Stinger finally rounded out an advantage of Thimble when he was able to prick Thimbles primary hand and injecting a small dose of his Stinger Venom into Thimble.
With the weakened arm, Stinger landed a double leg down kick onto thimbles hand, making him drop his weapon, and, with the momentum Stinger got from the kick, he flew into the air and launched his stinger javelin right into thimbles left eye, and through his entire skull
Interestingly Stinger didn’t inject the venom to finish thimble off, and instead let the defeated owl fall to the ground in agony, and went to go retrieve his phone before remarking on the close fight, then splitting.
Thimble later blamed his team for the loss, but would soon find out that he himself had improvements to make, not in strength, but in tactics, intelligence, and in leadership abilities
He and Hell stinger will later encounter each other again, except as allies against  common enemy, Electro
