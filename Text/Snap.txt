Snap is evil yep
One of the bad guys for life.
His parents were bakers but MAN did he like tearing the flesh off of things.
It starts with his love of grapes.
Snap loved grapes like just really loved them.
But the SKIN of these grapes was just MEANINGLESS.
Like what the FUCK.
so he started delicately peeling off the skin of grapes.
He did this a lot.
But then grape prices went way up and he just couldn’t afford them anymore.
I mean he could but he wouldn’t let society win.
Now he is a serial murder apart of the second highest rank villain group known as the MURDERxTORTURE GANGGANG
He’s defeated some very nice people and has stripped some owls down to their skin, leaving them featherless. 
Multiple times they get turned on by this.
Which Snap is NOT opposed to.
He’s killed some good owls and has blackmailed others by threatening to release evidence of him and the hero doing some SERIOUS BDSM.
In PUBLIC.
But mostly he hangs back from the crowds, finding one or two owls to smack around and strip of their feathers.
The SECOND grape prices return to normal he will quit his job and work the fryers at Johnny Whoppers.
His parents send him muffins EVERY DAY.
And he LOVES them.
Owlda Linn MIGHT be the reason why grape prices have gone up after buying out several grape producing  franchises and then maxing out all of their company loans and then “donating” it back to the market after a “slight miscalculation” made after drinking an “irresponsibly large amount of alcohol” therefore making all of the companies going bankrupt leaving the only living one with a corporate monopoly over the grape industry with the ability to set the price of grapes to whatever they want. 
DONT TELL SNAP.
