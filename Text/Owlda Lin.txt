There’s a legend about Owlda Lin
It claims that Owlda Linn is the last in his family
Of which all burned out their life force into the oblivion
Nobody knows why or if it was some suicidal fuckshit
But Owlda Linn knows just what the fuck is up with it
See Owlda Linn doesn’t give many fucks and his doctor said that he wouldn’t live long
Linn said “fuck ‘at I live as long as I want”
The doctor proceeded to inscribe his his hypothesis
Which said that Linn was as dumb as a bag of bricks
fuck that, thought Linn as he packed his bags for school
He was gonna graduate before the sun went down
The dude took every class and got straight A’s 
He finished all his school in a single day but he had to pay for his classes before he could graduate
So he took the money that he got from his families deaths, and saw the Owl City market and got jacked to the tits
He bet the SDS would Fail which it never did and lost all his money that he put in
So he took all his family’s fortunes and double dipped
Bingo
Now he was rich with some investors on his back saying that his practices were using illegal tactics
When they went to the court case Linn called up his defense which was his doctor that he had previously met.
“You know what you said yesterday?”
“Yeah”
“Say it again”
He used the doctors quote to prove that he was too dumb to do anything malicious
He won the case and paid off his tuition
Now a quadrillionaire it was time for the big leagues, enrolled in the SSDS and went straight for the top rank
“Anybody steps up to me and I’ll put you down”
“I’m a jack of all trades and a master of all”
He took all the highest fights on the list
Fought against SuperVillain on his very first mission
With no team it’d be certain death, with no chance to escape
But if he’s destined to die then he’ll go out in flames
During the fight a comet flew by the sky that day
It was the Sovereign Blade that would hail to the worthy
The worthy the brave and the courageous
With this Linn slayed SuperVillain and won the top spot
Free to retire forever in the first week of his life
He now explores the world wearing the brand of Anarchy
And finally learned the curse of his family
An undiagnosed severe deficiency in self preservation
But Owlda wouldn’t die, he is his families pride
And when he finds another owl to have a kid with
He’ll make sure they will never have the same disorders as he did
