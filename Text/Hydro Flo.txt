Sid Anderson comes from a family of two dads who were doctors, one who became a Soul Retriever Specialist up in cloud Thunderedge.
It was to their surprise that their son had the ability to generate hydrofluoric acid from his stomach, liver, and a little from his lungs
But Sid is a generally weaker hero because his powers do not safely meld with him; his stomachs isnâ€™t able to completely negate the effects of the hydrofluoric acid and his lungs generating hydrofluoric acid instead of carbonic acid that would turn into carbon dioxide ends up harming his breathing ability resulting in his lungs filling up with the acid
His dads being doctors took this as a challenge and were thankful that Sid was their son so they could give him the treatment that they he needed.
But Sid did learn of interesting ways of utilizing this acid, learning how to do some basic mechanical work and fluid dynamics in order to control the flow of his acid, he eventually invented an apparatus that he could connect to the medical system that his dads had made for him that would neutralize the negative effects of the acid.
He has been upgrading the apparatus as he learns more about engineering and eventually made his way to Owl City to debut his powers for the SSDS
A main reason why he wanted to be a hero was because of the body alterations that are made available to owls with a higher power.
They can alter their bodies in numerous ways to provide themselves with battle advantages and sometimes just cosmetic changes. One of these alterations is the True Body alteration that basically converts most body functions from being done by separate organs to instead having no organs and just simply absorbing power and energy and converting it to whatever their bodies require.
Sid Anderson would like to have this body conversion but is likely never to get to that ranking
That is, if he is doing solo Hero work, which he was doing until he met his future friend and potential partner Quinn Vigintillion, who was a high rank owl from the Damage Family, and despite being advised to not associate himself with lower ranks, Quinn found Sid Anderson story to be quite compelling.
They now have their own team who are on their way to the higher ranks.
