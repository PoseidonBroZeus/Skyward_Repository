Ricke Thobin was lost by his parents when he was young because he accidentally blurred himself when he was a chick and made himself impossible to see.
Cooleo eventually found him sitting by the window of a samurai restaurant that looked like a giant ship.
He called his parents (by guessing their phone number) and told them that their child wanted Chinese food and if he should give him the chicken friend rice or the rice friend chicken. 
They told him Chicken fried rice and how the fuck did he find their child.
After being returned to his parents, they gave him some shoes with bells on them so that they could hear where he was.
Ricke grew up well and liked practicing the art of blurring lines, he encountered a battle between two owls, one an SSDS member and the other a MurderTorture GangGang member, the owls was losing the fight and needed help.
Before he got got Ricke blurred the owl away and made him incredibly hard to detect, after doing this the owl was able to turn the fight around and win.
He got called up for interference without a license, but got away Scott free because he was already going to join the hero force and additionally the owl he saved was named Scott so if you free Scott then you’re Scott free.
He went back to the Chinese restaurant and asked for the knives that were the size of samurai swords.
They said those were swords and not knives.
He said they both cut things.
They gave him a fortune cookie that said ‘you stupid’.
And gave him 5 swords of varying size, saying that the hidden blades would give him an advantage.
If the enemy can’t tell which is which, then they could play way wrong.
It was a bit of a gamble, but Ricke had a good poker face.
He’s a good guy who also enjoys listening to Bobby Joe a lot, and one day hopes to become a musician, but for now he remains a good hero.
