To clarify
Ray Carmine is moon, not an owl
Some unwisely owls have assumed in the past that Ray Carmine is a crazed worshiper of a distant moon
But he is in fact that moon
The body he projects is an effigy of himself, as when moons like him become strong enough, they can start projecting more than just light
A moon usually isn’t sentient and often isn’t holding any real power
The only thing most moons do is reflect light, not project it, this is a common giveaway of which moon has power 
Ray Carmine is a moon that lost its sun some time ago and has been drifting around empty space for some time
He gained his power from when the sun he orbited went supernova
It’s blast splattered the matter of the sun and other planets in the way onto Ray Carmine
He was knocked into orbit with new power but all alone
At this time he was an infant, with no knowledge of what he was
He was later found by a group of star farmers, owl world itself doesn’t have a sun, it’s substitute being Cloud Thunderedge, a cloud that orbits the supermassive planet, providing light to the world at semi regulated hours
Star farmers would find non sentient stars and gather them together in a tow-truck manner, selling the to owls who either need a large supply of energy, or who created their own planet and are on the market for a global lighting source
Ray Carmine was quite the bright moon and got noticed by the farmers. After they realized he was a living thing, they quickly sent for the Celestial Bodies Bureau, the co-founder being President Godhoot
Not to be confused with Lord Godhoot
When the Bureau got word, they sent a convoy to retrieve Ray Carmine, after they did, they sent him to the celestial realm where the Mother Moons would raise him for a time and teach him how to astral project himself.
He learned quickly and made some friends there too
They told him about Owl World and said soon he’d be able to project himself down there on Celestial Day, a time where new stars would project themselves down to the surface of owl world where a large party was being hosted for them.
The festival would be hosted by Father Star (which is what they call President Godhoot even though he keeps restating that he’s not their daddy), Ruler Star (Lord Godhoot, even though he never actually shows,) and the Star Arbiter, Deneye
On this day Ray Carmine would meet a lot of people and make friends with some SSDS members, two people he had a special interest in were Quinn Vigintillion and Sid Anderson
He wanted to be an SSDS member with the two of them, they thought it would be cool and that they could teach him some cool things like
Unfortunately as Celestial Day ended, Ray Carmine would be pulled out of range of owl world, back into the cosmos.
He wanted to live in owls world, but as a newbie was only allowed to stay in Triple Outer Orbit of their planet, which game him roughly 63/365 days out of the year on owl world before he would get blocked out for a while
He would cherish these days and would hardly sleep the whole 63 days he was down there for, which was a potential hazard as celestial bodies who do not sleep are at higher risk of core fatigue and possibly failure, which would lead to a supernova or an implosion.
But Ray Carmine really adored the owls on Owl World, and would utilize every second he had own there and would stay awake after falling out of cycle of the planet thinking about what all his friends were probably up to.
He would ask closer planets what they knew, and would every now and then pesk Deneye to check on his friends, who would only do it if Cooleo was there to convince him.
