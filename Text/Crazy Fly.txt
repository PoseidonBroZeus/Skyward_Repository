Penii Pennington is a deaf owl with the ability to produce a plentiful supply of decomposition fluids 
This fluid is similar to that of acid but is not considered one and is much less potent
But unlike all other acids, decomposition fluid does not have any passivation chemicals that neutralize its burn
But it is a slow process and therefore Penii is not considered a high rank fighter 
Peni lives close to owl city but doesn’t have much concern for being a hero class
They’re a part of a disabled hero group but they are rarely taken seriously
Another reason why Penii isn’t respected is because the power ranking is damage based and adjacent skills aren’t considered 
Which brings us to Penii’s strongest ability
Hyper-fly dodge
This is the strongest dodge ability recorded, changing Penii’s base speed from a base speed of 100% and increasing it to a maximum of one quintillion % excess for 1/10 of a second
This is an auto dodge and Penii does not need to be aware of an attack to dodge it
It’s strong
But Penii remains ignored for a while and usually spends time with their family members
Owls use a universal sign language to communicate, which is only needed prior to Gamies appearance
But Penii has snuck out to get involved with real SDS heroes and sometimes pokes around to find out where members are planning to go to
Penii has followed several members and has fought several higher ranked enemies
But due to endangering themselves and the other SDS member, Penii isn’t credited much
Unless the member is Cooleo
Cooleo is scorned for allowing a disabled person to be in harms way, not accepting Penii saying that they’re cool with it 
Cooleo usually says “Penii can do whatever they damn want I don’t control what they do”
“Plus they better them summa you folks around here”
Cooleo respects Penii along with their ambiguity in gender
Owls can choose whatever they wanna be whenever they wanna
Penii just haven’t decided and Cooleo is cool with that
And also doesn’t really give a fuck
Cooleo has helped Penii design their costume and regarding their disability actually recommended talking to Gamie
Which was a fucking insane thing to do considering Gamie was currently a super villain at large when Cooleo recommended this
But not all of Cooleos encounters with Gamie have been violent and so Cooleo knows that Gamie can do some cool things
Gamie will later completely restore Penii’s hearing along with any other disability any other owl has had
