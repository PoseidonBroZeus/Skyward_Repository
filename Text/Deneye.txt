Deneye is a retired super hero from the SDS
Most superheroes follow the same relative trend when it comes to the recent power demands in heroes 
In recent times owls have to dedicate more and more time to heroic tasks clocking in 60-100hour work weeks
This is just to maintain their current power position, their only way to move up is to either not sleep at all and grind out fighting villains , or do take on enemies way above your current rank
This doesn’t mean that power stays the same, every week you can gain more power and still maintain the same rank if everyone is keeping up too
It gets to a point where even low levels possess enough power to level a small town by themselves
Deneye was a veteran of the hero force
He originates from the stars similar to that of Ray Carmine, being a black whole he can project himself at any time, but his projected body isn’t all of him
But he can still do normal owl things
His only powers is his practically indestructible body, his omnipotent eye in his stomach, and his singularity beam of infinite energy
I say only like it’s not one of the strongest loadouts an owl can have
He isn’t Gamie so he can’t keep an eye on everyone, but he can find everyone and always knows their relative location
His powers led him to being a top rank immediately, with the achievement of defeating the dark star once and assisting in a Gamie uprise.
He can defeat many owls, but still has counters, battery-type fighters can drain his beams to a certain degree (but not indefinitely), and like many he shows struggle against Busta Billy
But Billy is the most powerful reflect fighter so it’s understandable.
But neither of them can actually harm Deneye so for him it’s usually not a matter of dying, just failing to defeat the enemy.
The only ability to directly counter Deneye is Cooleo’s Scooter, the perspective-based slow moving projectile that can destroy Deneye in one hit.
Deneye is no longer living on owl world, most owls who finally reach the top of the power ranking tend to thereafter depart from the cities of owl world, moving upwards and outwards
Eventually they leave the planet entirely and sign to no longer be responsive to enemy threats unless it is a threat that is substantially more severe
Deneye is now a recluse, living on an obelisk in the center of his own black hole, overseeing owl world and providing insights on the location of enemies from time to time.
He is no longer very social
But he does chat with Cooleo who visits the obelisk, bringing sugary beverages and snacks
Having spent time together regularly, Cooleo is the only one who knows about Deneye having a lover star
He talks about her a lot with Cooleo
His job now is observing new colonies forming at the edge of the universe and determining their attributes, in worse cases where they show no sign of compromising and only aggression, he will be obligated to Deneye the planets existence
