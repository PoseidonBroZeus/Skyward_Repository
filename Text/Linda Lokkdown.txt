Linda lokkdown is another lock based owl like Igor Lokkdin, with the last lock user being Perceval Lokkdout
But he has locked most people out of his existence, with some rumoring that he is hiding something.
Linda is the youngest of the lock owls, being born at the start of the Age of Revival; her power is strong but unlike the other lock users, she can actually defend herself pretty well with her Padlockers.
They do some pretty good damage and she gets some pretty nasty combos by locking you into place with every hit.
She grew up in the town Igor Lokkdin came from and read his stories about unlocking doors to hidden places, this idea charmed Linda but she wanted to tweak the lock type power to her needs.
She does not have the ability to unlock doors but can place locks on doors that only she has the key to, which can be annoying when she locks you out of your own home.
Her special ability to lock down also works in combat when she clamps someone between both of her Padlockers.
This will trap them in a small pocket dimension of hers, which is locked with a key that she keeps on herself.
She’s a collector and has traveled abroad to find things and keep them in one of her lockers, she has taken various things in her time, some things simple, some rare objects, a few godly items, and one or two owls who kind of annoyed her.
She isn’t a hero, and usually does what she wants, eventually though she wants to get close enough to owls and friends enough to allow them into her personal locker.
The key to this locker is tattooed on her body and is the key to her heart.
Nobody has ever gotten this privilege except for the occasional Cooleo encounter where she temporarily lets him in so they can have deep talks
She’s met Owlda Linn before and considers joining him on his journeys in adventure and discovery, but hesitates due to him being kind of a sporadic mess.
